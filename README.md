Hi Mr. Smith,

Hope you are having a great day! 

I just wanted to send you a quick note to say thank you again for participating in our **Introduction to iOS for New Coders** session on September 27th. We are so excited to have you run the course in-person at the **Utah Valley University**, and I would greatly appreciate if you could email me back to confirm your participation.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I’ll be happy to help. :-)

Best,

Michelle Sunga
